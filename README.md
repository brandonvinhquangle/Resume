# WebDev_Project
This "Final Project" is very different from your other end-of-module assessments. It is not timed and there are no questions to answer. Instead, you're going to build a super awesome professional-looking website based on your résumé and the bootstrap technique taught in the last chapter of this module. You can begin this project by using what you built in that chapter. Next, if you haven't already, you should implement all of the details of your résumé in that bootstrap-based website. Finally, make sure each of the requirements below is met in your finished website. Each requirement below will necessitate you to apply one or more principles taught in the WebDev module.

This project is completely open book and open web, yet closed person—as usual. There is also no time limit except it should be completed by the due date. So take your time and make this website look great! Also, if you are a graduate student taking this class, please notice the additional requirements at the end.
